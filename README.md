# Belbe, Corrupted Spelltable Observer
ðŸš§ WIP
## Overview
Belbe, Corrupted Spelltable Observer is a Chrome extention for reading data from Spelltable.
The intention behind this extension is to pull data from the front end of the client and make it reusable in an such as OBS.

## What is Spelltable?
[Spelltable](https://spelltable.wizards.com/) is a platform used to remotely play various types of game variant of Magic The Gathering via webcam. 

## Version Zero aims to:
- [] Read and save life totals.
- [] Start/stop observing.
- [] Pass data to OBS via websocket.

## Version 1.0 aims to:
- [] Read and save names of Commanders.
- [] Read and save names of players.
- [] Read and save player pronouns.
- [] Read and save game time.

## Extra scope
- Read player states
  - is Monarch.
  - is Eliminated.
  - Commander damage from players.
  - infect count.
  - Commander colour identity
- save Commander image from scryfall.
- test data.
- option to feed data straight to Streamer.bot rather than saving values.
- game timer.
